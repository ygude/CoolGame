First part notes:
This is the first time that I used cmake, so what I did to build it is really basic. 
Mostly following tutorials and crash courses. Because of this, I am sure that this is not following any best practices. But it looks functional to my eyes.
Second part notes:
I didn't have that much time to build this very sophisticated. I attached only the pipeline script, I used a docker Jenkins but didn't have sufficient time to make a more version that I could ship easily. 
This is the content of the dockerfile I used :
"FROM jenkins/jenkins:lts

USER root
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y cmake build-essential g++"
I used the built-in jenkins node to build it, but I added a label to it.
There would also be some alerting for failure/success that I did not add for a POC style.
Also I did not create an artifact of the executable to be shipped to a repository, but that was not mentioned .
I added a screenshot with the runs that I did which are: 
    1. The unmodified files - which fail at test stage because the second test fails
    2. Modified the test to pass 
    3. Modified the main.cpp to try to include an non-existing library, which caused the build stage to fail.
